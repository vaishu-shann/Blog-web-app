At the end of the day, we can only count on ourselves because no matter what ‘you have you, when you don’t have anyone else’. Only we understand our thoughts that haunt us at night, we have to trust ourselves because trusting people is temporary, they are not going to be with us no matter how much they love us because their priority will change someday, their feelings will fade away all of a sudden and one day they won’t love us either. Only we are truly capable of saving  "
